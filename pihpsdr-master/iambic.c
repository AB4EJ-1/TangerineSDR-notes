*
* The code implements an Iambic CW keyer.  The following features are supported:
*
*         * Variable speed control from 1 to 60 WPM
*         * Dot and Dash memory
*         * Straight, Bug, Iambic Mode A or B Modes
*         * Variable character weighting
*         * Automatic Letter spacing
*         * Paddle swap
*
* Dot and Dash memory works by registering an alternative paddle closure whilst a paddle is pressed.
* The alternate paddle closure can occur at any time during a paddle closure and is not limited to being
* half way through the current dot or dash. This feature could be added if required.
*
* In Straight mode, closing the DASH paddle will result in the output following the input state.  This enables a
* straight morse key or external Iambic keyer to be connected.
*
* In Bug mode closing the dot paddle will send repeated dots.
*
* The difference between Iambic Mode A and B lies in what the keyer does when both paddles are released. In Mode A the
* keyer completes the element being sent when both paddles are released. In Mode B the keyer sends an additional
* element opposite to the one being sent when the paddles are released.
*
* This only effects letters and characters like C, period or AR.
*
* Automatic Letter Space works as follows: When enabled, if you pause for more than one dot time between a dot or dash
* the keyer will interpret this as a letter-space and will not send the next dot or dash until the letter-space time has been met.
* The normal letter-space is 3 dot periods. The keyer has a paddle event memory so that you can enter dots or dashes during the
* inter-letter space and the keyer will send them as they were entered.
*
* Speed calculation -  Using standard PARIS timing, dot_period(mS) = 1200/WPM

 * Description of a major overhaul,
 * Sep/Oct/Nov 2018, by DL1YCF Christoph van Wullen
 ***************************************************************************************************************
 *
 * a) SOME MINOR TECHNICAL ISSUES:
 * ===============================
 *
 * -keyer_close was actually unused. It is now called when local CW is no longer used
 *      and "joins" (terminates) the keyer thread.
 *
 * - GPIO pin names are no longer used in iambic.c
 *
 * - cw_keyer_spacing can now be set/un-set in the CW menu (cw_menu.c)
 *
 * - changing the scheduling policy now becomes only effective for the keyer thread, because
 *   sched_setscheduler() is called at the beginning and the end of the keyer thread with
 *   pid argument 0 (even better: use gettid() return value).
 *   NOTE: this is Linux-specific. Better switch to POSIX calls (e.g. pthread_setschedparam).
 *   mlockall and munlockall still apply process-wide and are therefore executed in
 *   keyer_init/keyer_close.
 *
 * b) SIDE TONE GENERATION
 * =======================
 *
 * There is a possibility to generate a side tone on one of the GPIO ports. This is necessary at
 * speeds greater than 20 wpm since there is a 50 msec delay (due to the LINUX sound system) between
 * generating the side tone and when it finally appears in the head-phone. The GPIO side tone comes
 * without a delay.
 *
 * The volume of the CW side tone in the standard audio channel is reduced to zero while producing
 * a square wave on the GPIO pin. The idea is to low-pass this signal and combine it with the audio
 * output (hardware mixer).
 *
 * In the previous version, the side tone was generate using the softTone functionality of wiringPI
 * within the GPIO module. However, this has a drawback:
 * one creates two high-priority threads (the tone generator and the keyer)
 * both firing at high speed (once a milli-sec and faster). This made the frequency of the tone quite
 * unstable. Instead, the side tone is now explicitly generated within the keyer (if GPIO side tone is activated)
 * by periodically writing "1" and "0" to the GPIO output while waiting for the end of the just-being-sent
 * dot or dash. Furthermore, the frequency of the side tone has been stabilized by "sleeping" UNTIL the
 * pre-calculated output-switching time (and not FOR the calculated amount, this is, using TIMER_ABSTIME
 * in clock_nanosleep).
 *
 * c) CW VOX
 * =========
 *
 * Suppose you hit the paddle while in RX mode. In this case, the SDR automatically switches
 * to TX, and remains so until a certain time (actually cw_keyer_hang_time, can be set in
 * the CW menu) has passed since sending the last element (then, PTT is removed).
 *
 * - cw_keyer_spacing can now be set/un-set in the CW menu (cw_menu.c)
 *
 * - during a dot or dash when no GPIO side tone is produced, the keyer thread simply waits and
 *   does no busy spinning.
 *
 * d) DOT/DASH MEMORY
 * ==================
 *
 * For reasons explained below, it is necessary to have TWO such memories for both dot and dash,
 * they are called dot_memory/dot_held and dash_memory/dash_held. Everything explained here and below
 * likewise holds for dot/dash exchanged.
 *
 * dot_memory is set whenever the dot paddle is hit. The natural way to do this is in the interrupt
 * service routine. So, keyer_event is the ONLY place where dot_memory is set. When the keyer wants to
 * know whether the dot paddle has been hit in some interval in time, it has to RESET dot_memory at the
 * beginning of the interval and can then read it out any time later.
 *
 * While the dot paddle may have been hit long ago, it is of interest whether is was still held at
 * the beginning of the last dash. Therefore, the keyer can store the state of the dot paddle in the
 * variable dot_held. This is done at the beginning of sending a dash. dot_held is separate from
 * dot_memory because only dot_held (but not dot_memory) is cleared in iambic mode A when both
 * paddles are released.
 *
 * e) IAMBIC MODES A AND B, AND SINGLE-LEVER PADDLES
 * =================================================
 *
 * It seems that there are lively discussions about what is what, so I distilled out the
 * following and added one clarification that becomes important when using this mode
 * with single-lever paddles:
 *
 * Suppose you hit the dash paddle and squeeze immediately afterwards (both paddles held),
 * then the keyer is supposed to produce a "dah dit dah dit dah dit .... " sequence. This is
 * what "iambic" is all about.
 *
 * Now what happens if you release BOTH paddles just after the second "dah" starts to sound?
 * In Mode-A you produce the letter "K" (dah dit dah), while in Mode-B, you produce the letter
 * "C" (dah dit dah dit). This is consensus. In this implementation, I follow the plead of
 * KO0B which I found on the internet and which essentially states that the "time window" for
 * releasing both paddles should extend until the end of the delay following the second "dah".
 * This is not only more convenient but also mimics the behaviour of the original Curtis
 * mode A 8044 chip (KO0B says).
 *
 * This means that at the end of the delay following a dash, in Mode-B the condition for
 * producing a dot is:
 *
 * -dot paddle has been held at the beginning of the last dash OR
 * -dot paddle is just being held OR
 * -dot paddle has been hit (and possibly already been released) during the time window
 *     from the beginning of the dash until now.
 *
 * This implies that in dot_held, the state of the dot key at the beginning of a dash is
 * stored, and that dot_memory is cleared at the beginning of a dash.
 *
 * To implement MODE-A, we clear dot_held at the end of the delay following the dash,
 * when both keys are released at that point in time.
 * We do not clear dot_memory in this case! Why?
 *
 * All the definitions on mode A/B I found relate to releasing keys that have been
 * squeezed for some time. Nothing is said about what happens if a key has been
 * recently hit. I am sometimes using a single-lever paddle, and at higher speeds,
 * I have also observed that I use a standard (dual-lever) paddle this way, namely
 * alternatingly hitting the paddle (shortly releasing the dash paddle when hitting
 * the dot one, and then possibly re-activating the dash paddle).
 *
 * It seems consensus that using a single-lever paddle, there should be no difference
 * between mode-A and mode-B.
 *
 * So imagine you want to produce the letter "N" (dah dit) this way. You will hit the dash key,
 * then immediately afterwards the dot key, and possibly have both keys released 
 * when the final dot of the letter should start. The final dot should not be suppressed
 * even in mode-A.
 * Thus: if both keys have been held at the beginning of a dash, and are relased
 * during the dash or the delay following, this dash is the last element being produced in mode-A.
 * BUT, if the dot key has been hit during the dash (or the delay following it), then a dot
 * element will be produced both in mode-A and mode-B, it is not necessary to keep on holding
 * the dot key.
 *
 * The present implementation will make both types happy: those doing pure squeeze and
 * those releasing one paddle when hitting the other.
